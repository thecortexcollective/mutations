    const visartStatement = `The mirror, the <i>Beholder</i>, is the manifestation of dysmorphia
                that lingers in the back of one's mind. With its cracks and
                infestations, it asks the twisted question: “If beauty is in my
                eyes, don’t the flaws exist there too?” So, as you look into the
                Beholder, you are met with a nightmarish version of yourself. A
                parasitic perception. Monarch butterflies stare into its cracks and
                find the parasite, ophryocystis elektroscirrha (OE), crumpling their
                wings, stripping them of a beauty once revered by all. The Beholder
                inadvertently reflects the ever-changing beauty standards in our
                world that tell people, especially women, that no matter how
                beautiful you may be, you’ll never be good enough in their eyes.
                Don’t look in the eyes of the Beholder.`;

    const musicStatement = `<i>Parisitosis</i> captures the essence of existence -
                perception mixed with multiplication. As each melody repeats,
                something small within the piece is changed - the swaying of the
                synths, the speed of the tremolo. Small changes are meant to mask
                the way we see the world. Our perceptions are constantly changing.
                We mutate according to our surroundings, yet our memories are
                parasites within our psyches. They involuntarily multiply, and our
                experiences make us grow stronger.`;

                Humans have taken more than they give. This imbalance
                has directly led to the destruction of Earth's ecosystems
                and the extinction of countless species. Clearly the
                perception of humans as inherently selfish creatures -
                parasites feeding upon the earth - certainly has validity.
                Yet, I argue that this perception doesn't have to be fixed.
                As Sadie shows us through her mutation, humans are capable
                of great acts of sacrifice and selflessness - if only we
                have the courage and willingness to do so. Wake up, dear
                reader. You and I have power, power to wield the flame that
                burns and regrows - to change the future, to change the world.

                <i>Striga</i> by Mara Klein
            </button>
            <p class="statement" id="i-statement">
                As a stereotypical EVST major, I first encountered
                <i>Striga hermonthica</i> down a rabbit hole of frenzied
                botanical research. My spiral resulted in an obscene
                amount of open Wikipedia tabs and this poem. Striga is
                a parasitic flower that infects cereal crops. Its roots
                scour the surrounding soil until it encounters the roots
                of its host; it then secretes digestive enzymes, making
                the host bleed out quinone compounds from its damaged tissue.
                When it senses a sufficient quinone concentration, Striga
                releases a haustorium, a root-like structure that penetrates
                the host and siphons away nutrients and energy. During my
                research, I was struck by Striga's common name: witchweed.
                In this piece, I wanted to explore the social distortion of
                femininity and the connotations of consumption and mutation.
                I hope that it will provoke readers to be aware of subtle
                manifestations of misogyny throughout history.
